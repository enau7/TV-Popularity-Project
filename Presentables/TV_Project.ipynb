        "The streaming services industry has seen rapid growth in recent years and has undoubtedly revolutionized the way we consume content. With numerous platforms offering a vast array of TV shows, it has become increasingly important for creators and streaming platforms to understand what makes a TV show popular. This project aims to explore the Kaggle dataset and uncover key factors that contribute to the popularity of TV shows on streaming platforms through a series of different models.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **type**: Indicates whether the show is a TV series or a movie.\n",
        "- **title**: The title of the TV show.\n",

        "Together, these variables provide a set of features that allow us to analyze and understand the characteristics that determine the popularity of TV shows. By exploring these variables and their relationships, we can gain insights into the factors that contribute to a show's popularity, like the impact of different genres or countries of origin, and begin to create better shows that more people would watch.\n",
