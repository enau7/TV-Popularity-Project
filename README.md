# TV Show and Movie Popularity Prediction
Using data from streaming services to tv show and movie popularity.

## Completed:
- Gathered and compiled initial Data
- Used API to get IMDB rating data

## Next Steps:
Data has some mixed-in values with ratings and duration. We need to find all the columns where ratings has a duration value, and put it back into the duration column.

Can we find budget / revenue data? Probably not, it looks like you have to pay (a lot) for it, but we could try.
