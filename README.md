# TV Show and Movie Popularity Prediction
Using data from streaming services to tv show and movie popularity.

## Completed:
- Gathered and compiled initial data
- Used API to get IMDB rating data
- Fixed rating / duration mixup
- Turned `genre` into a factor variable, with levels which are not mutually exclusive.

## Next Steps:
Start fitting models, continue with visualization.

Can we find budget / revenue data? Probably not, it looks like you have to pay (a lot) for it, but we could try.
